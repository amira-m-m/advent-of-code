# Advent of Code

## Introduction

**Advent of Code** was suggested to me by a friend as a fun and semi-practical way to reinforce programming knowledge.

It's an annual event created by [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz) in which a series of coding challenges are released in the format of an advent calendar. Although December is when the event is primarily hosted, the challenges can still be accessed and completed any time of year.

I'll be using this repository to store my solutions for each challenge I complete - aiming for all 25! My programming language of choice for the 2023 set (which I'm actually completing in the Summer of '24) is **JavaScript**.

Interested in trying it out yourself? Read more about how it works [here](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about).

## Instructions

### To view solutions as raw code...

* Open the `public` folder
* Open the folder corresponding to the annual set of interest.
* Open the folder corresponding to the daily challenge of interest.

### To view solutions as interactive web pages...

* Clone the project to your local system.
* Use a terminal to navigate to your project folder.
* Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
* Run `node server.js` to initialize a local server.
