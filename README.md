# Advent of Code

**Advent of Code** was suggested to me by a friend as a fun and semi-practical way to reinforce programming knowledge.

It's an annual event created by [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz) in which a series of coding challenges are released in the format of an advent calendar. Although December is when the event is primarily hosted, the challenges can still be accessed and completed any time of year.

I'll be using this repository to store my solutions for each challenge I complete - aiming for all 25! My programming language of choice for the 2023 set (which I'm actually completing in the Summer of '24) is **JavaScript**.

Interested in trying it out yourself? Read more about how it works [here](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about).
